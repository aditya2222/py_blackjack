# py_blackjack
A simple Blackjack game created in Python
Copy the code from blackjack to your Python IDE and run and also keep the svg cards in the same directory as that of the main source pyhton code file.
It is currently under development. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.
Will release the binary version after stable release of the code so that you guys can run the .exe(binary file) directly
Thank You!
